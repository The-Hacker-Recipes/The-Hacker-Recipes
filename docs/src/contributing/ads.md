# Sponsor ðŸŒŸ

The Hacker Recipes is a free platform, created in 2020, dedicated to theoretical and practical guides on offensive security.
Our mission is simple: to share knowledge by providing harmonized, reliable, and high-quality content on ethical offensive cybersecurity.

If you're a company or an individual who wants to support our mission, you can do so by donating to the project ([donate](/contributing/donate.md)), or by sponsoring it and gain visibility among our community.

Two options are available: a banner at the beginning of each article and a
sponsor grid. The various options and their pricing details are outlined later
in this document.

Two options are available:
