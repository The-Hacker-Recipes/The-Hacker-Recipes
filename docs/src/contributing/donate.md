# Donate ❤️

The Hacker Recipes is a community-driven project dedicated to providing high-quality, open-source resources for cybersecurity professionals and enthusiasts. 

To continue offering valuable content, expand its reach, and improve its offerings, the project relies on the support of its community. 
Your donations play a crucial role in sustaining the platform, covering 
- the time we, maintainers ([Charlie](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nwodtuhs/) and [Charles](https://www.linkedin.com/in/charlesaimin/)), spend on it
- the financial or swag incentives for contributors
- hosting and development costs
