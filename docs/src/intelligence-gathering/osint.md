# OSINT

## Theory

When it comes to social engineering, gathering information about the target is crucial, especially if you target a specific person.

> If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle. (_Art of war, Sun Tzu_)

In this part we will see how to get information about people, which could be useful to personalize social engineering attacks to make them more efficient.
