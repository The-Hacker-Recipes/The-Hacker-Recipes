# Account creation

## Theory

When creating an account the presence of a captcha is important. It helps to differentiate a real human user from a malicious computer program used by an attacker. In theory, when characters are distorted, robots are unable to decipher them.

This visual test is a security measure to prevent a website or forum from being flooded with spam, advertising messages and fake users for example.

## Practice 

Check for the presence of captcha and others security mechanisms such as email verification.
