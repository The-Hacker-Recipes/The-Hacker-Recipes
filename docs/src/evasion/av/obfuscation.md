## Theory

Obfuscation is a way to hide a shellcode. generally symmetric algorithms are used

## Practice

### Manual obfuscation

Below is a list of ways that allow you to go under the radar of anti-virus software, so put all the chances on your side and use several techniques.\
You should also `change the logo` of the binary as well as its `description` and its `creation date` (sandboxes check that the binary is not too recent).

#### Shellcode encoding

For this part the principle is simple: camouflaged its active load, to do this you will need to code a function to encode, but also to decode, free to choose algorithm this technique works particularly well for static bypass.

Here is a link that will allow you to understand and write your first program:

#### Indirect syscall

the principle of this method is to call directly the memory addresses instead of using the API functions an article which explains things very well is [this one](https://medium.com/@merasor07/av-edr-evasion-using-direct-system-calls-user-mode-vs-kernel-mode-fad2fdfed01a).

#### Delayed execution

In order to compromise the machine discreetly, sleeps are also used a lot, There are several methods: `WaitForSingleObjectEx, Foliage, Ekko, Deathsleep.`

A good part of them are very well explained at the following address : [https://evasions.checkpoint.com/techniques/timing.html#delayed-execution](https://evasions.checkpoint.com/techniques/timing.html#delayed-execution)

#### Disable ETW

There are several ways to disable logging, either via `nt!EtwpStopTrace`, or `advapi32!EventWrite` but also `ntdll!ETWEventWrite.`

To better understand these keywords, I invite you to read this article: [https://www.binarly.io/posts/Design_issues_of_modern_EDRs_bypassing_ETW-based_solutions/index.html](https://www.binarly.io/posts/Design_issues_of_modern_EDRs_bypassing_ETW-based_solutions/index.html).

### Automatic obfuscation

Depending on your needs, you can use tools available for the most part on github, they are sorted by category below.
