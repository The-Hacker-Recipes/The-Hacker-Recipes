The following piece of C code is a simple example of DLL loader, where the DLL holds the malicious shellcode.

```c
#include 
#include 

int main(void) {
 HMODULE hMod = LoadLibrary("shellcode.dll");
 if (hMod == nullptr) {
 cout << "Failed to load shellcode.dll" << endl;
 }

 return 0;
}
```

Once the payload is completed, [pe-sieve](https://github.com/hasherezade/pe-sieve) can be used to identify if it is stealthy or not.
