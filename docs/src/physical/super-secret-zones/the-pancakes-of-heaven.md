# ðŸ¥ž The Pancakes of Heaven

## Theory

Those who made it here are one of the luckiest. The legend says that hackers who ate these pancakes saw the doors of heaven wide open! :open_mouth:

Following are the ingredients for 3 BIG PANCAKES (we wanna enter those doors, don't we? :eyes:):

* 1 banana
* 1 egg
* 3 tablespoons of coconut Milk 
* 70g of oatmeal 
* 1 teaspoon of AÃ§ai's powder 
* 1 tablespoon of Goji barries 
* 1 tablespoon of maizena 
* 1 teaspoon of baking powder

## Practice

1. In a container, mash the banana with the bottom of a fork
2. Add the egg and the coconut milk and mix
3. Add the AÃ§ai's powder, the maizena, the oatmeal and the baking powder and mix
4. Form 3 "perfectly-rounded" pancakes on a very hot stove and cook for 2 minutes on each side

Now, the most important part: the toppings. Plenty of options here but following are few: 

* Peanut butter with all sorts of nuts (nuts, almonds, cashew nuts, hazelnuts, etc.)
* Melted dark chocolate with berries (blue berries, red berries or whatever color berries)
* Maple syrup
