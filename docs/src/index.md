This project is aimed at providing technical guides on various hacking topics. The most advanced topics are Active Directory and Web services. Other topics will be added. The ultimate goal is to centralize all hacking techniques :eyes:

> [!SUCCESS] Exegol
> Almost all tools mentioned in these notes can be found in [Exegol](https://exegol.rtfd.io) (a professional alternative to offsec operating systems such as Kali Linux).

Cheatsheets are valuable resources, but they often either overwhelm with complexity or fall short by not providing enough context and explanation. This is not a cheatsheet project. Most of the content published here is original content, that's verified and tested whenever possible.

Keep in mind that these guides are maintained by non-omniscient security enthusiasts in their spare time. You will probably find things missing or mistakes. Writing all this takes time and effort and if you encounter errors, we will be more than happy to fix them :pray:
