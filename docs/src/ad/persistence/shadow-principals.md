# Shadow Principals (PAM)

## Theory

When a Bastion Forest is compromised, there are multiple ways to obtain persistence on the forest it manages (i.e. called "Production Forest" here).

1. Mark a low-privilege user from the Production Forest as an Shadow Security Principal in the Bastion Forest
2. Modify a Shadow Principal Object's DACL: add ACEs over a Shadow Principal Object (at least `Read Members` and `Write Members`) allowing a controlled user add and remove principals at will (in the `member` attribute.
