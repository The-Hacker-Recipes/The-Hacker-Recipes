# MS-FSRVP abuse (ShadowCoerce)

## Theory

MS-FSRVP is Microsoft's File Server Remote VSS Protocol. It's used for creating shadow copies of file shares on a remote computer, and for facilitating backup applications in performing application-consistent backup and restore of data on SMB2 shares ([docs.microsoft.com](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-fsrvp/dae107ec-8198-4778-a950-faa7edad125b)). That interface is available through the `\pipe\FssagentRpc` SMB named pipe.

In late 2021, [Lionel GILLES](https://twitter.com/topotam77) published [slides](https://twitter.com/topotam77/status/1475701014204461056) showcasing [PetitPotam](ms-efsr.md) and demonstrating the possibility of abusing the protocol to coerce authentications on the last two slides.

Similarly to other MS-RPC abuses, this works by using a specific method relying on remote UNC paths. In this case, at the time of writing, two methods were detected as vulnerable: `IsPathSupported` and `IsPathShadowCopied`.

The coerced authentications are made over SMB. Unlike other similar coercion methods (MS-RPRN printerbug, MS-EFSR petitpotam), I doubt MS-FSRVP abuse can be combined with [WebClient abuse](webclient.md) to elicit incoming authentications made over HTTP.

A requirement to the abuse is to have the "File Server VSS Agent Service" enabled on the target server.

> [!TIP]
> In June 2022, Microsoft patched [CVE-2022-30154](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2022-30154) in [KB5014692](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/kb5015527-shadow-copy-operations-using-vss-on-remote-smb-shares-denied-access-after-installing-windows-update-dated-june-14-2022-6d460245-08b6-40f4-9ded-dd030b27850b), which also patched this coercion attack.

## Practice

The following Python proof-of-concept ([https://github.com/ShutdownRepo/ShadowCoerce](https://github.com/ShutdownRepo/ShadowCoerce)) implements the `IsPathSupported` and `IsPathShadowCopied` methods.

> [!NOTE]
> For the proof of concept to work, using a proper security provider (`RPC_C_AUTHN_WINNT`) and authentication level (`RPC_C_AUTHN_LEVEL_PKT_PRIVACY`) can required. It is enabled by default in the script.

```bash
shadowcoerce.py -d "domain" -u "user" -p "password" LISTENER TARGET
```

> [!NOTE]
> In my tests, the coercion needed to be attempted twice in order to work when the FssAgent hadn't been requested in a while. In short, run the command again if it doesn't work the first time.
