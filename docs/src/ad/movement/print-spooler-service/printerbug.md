# PrinterBug

This vulnerability allows low-privileged users to coerce authentications from machines that run the Print Spooler Service by crafting a specific RPC call through MS-RPRN, Microsoft’s Print System Remote Protocol. It defines the communication of print job processing and print system management between a print client and a print server
