# Security groups

## Theory

> In the Windows Server operating system, there are several built-in accounts and security groups that are preconfigured with the appropriate rights and permissions to perform specific tasks. ([Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-R2-and-2012/dn579255(v=ws.11)?redirectedfrom=MSDN))

There are scenarios where testers can obtain full control over members of built-in security groups. The usual targets are members of the "Administrators", "Domain Admins" or "Entreprise Admins" groups, however, other groups can sometimes lead to major privileges escalation.

## Practice

Below is a table summing up some groups' rights and abuse paths.
