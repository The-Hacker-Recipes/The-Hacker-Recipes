# Overpass the hash

This technique is a form of [pass the key](ptk.md). 

Kerberos offers 4 different key types: DES, RC4, AES-128 and AES-256. 

When attackers know the RC4 key (which is in fact the user's NT hash), and when the RC4 etype is not disabled, they can use it to obtain Kerberos tickets.
