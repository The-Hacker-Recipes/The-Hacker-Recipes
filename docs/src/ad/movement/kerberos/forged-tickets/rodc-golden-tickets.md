# RODC Golden tickets

## Theory

With administrative access to an [RODC](../../builtins/rodc.md), it is possible to dump all the cached credentials, including those of the`krbtgt_XXXXX` account. The hash can be used to forge a "RODC golden ticket" for any account in the `msDS-RevealOnDemandGroup` and not in the `msDS-NeverRevealGroup` attributes of the RODC. This ticket can be presented to the RODC or any accessible standard writable Domain Controller to request a Service Ticket (ST).

> [!TIP]
> When presenting a RODC golden ticket to a writable (i.e. standard) Domain Controller, it is not worth crafting the PAC because it will be recalculated by the writable Domain Controller when issuing a service ticket (ST).

## Practice

::: tabs

=== UNIX-like

_For the moment, no tool is available to only forge a RODC Golden Ticket from UNIX-like systems._


=== Windows

From Windows systems, [Rubeus](https://github.com/GhostPack/Rubeus) (C#) can be used for this purpose.


```powershell
Rubeus.exe golden /rodcNumber:$KBRTGT_NUMBER /flags:forwardable,renewable,enc_pa_rep /nowrap /outfile:ticket.kirbi /aes256:$KRBTGT_AES_KEY /user:USER /id:USER_RID /domain:domain.local /sid:DOMAIN_SID
```
