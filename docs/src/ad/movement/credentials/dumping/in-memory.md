# In-memory secrets

## Theory

Just like the LSASS process on Windows systems allowing for [LSASS dumping](lsass.md), some programs sometimes handle credentials in the memory allocated to their processes, sometimes allowing attackers to dump them.

## Practice

> [!TIP]
> Just like [LSASS dumping](lsass.md), this technique needs the attacker to have admin access on the target machine since it involves dumping and handling volatile memory.

=== UNIX-like
On UNIX-like systems, tools like [mimipenguin](https://github.com/huntergregal/mimipenguin) (C, Shell, Python), [mimipy](https://github.com/n1nj4sec/mimipy) (Python) and [LaZagne](https://github.com/AlessandroZ/LaZagne) (Python) can be used to extract passwords from memory.

```bash
mimipenguin
laZagne memory
```
=== Windows

On Windows systems, tools like [LaZagne](https://github.com/AlessandroZ/LaZagne) (Python) and [mimikatz](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz) (C) can be used to extract passwords from memory but they focus on [LSASS dumping](lsass.md).
