# 🍳 Omelette du fromage

## Theory

The French dish "Omelette du fromage" is famously known for its ability to convey strength and resistance to its eaters. Its preparation and consumption is common for fast-paced attackers in need of daily nutrients.

The requirements for this omelette are as follow (for 1 attacker):

* 2 to 3 eggs :egg:&#x20;
* grated cheese :cheese: (the type of cheese is to be set depending on the attacker's mood and local resources)
* butter
* **option**: parsley can be added for improved taste :herb:&#x20;

A salad bowl, a spatula, a frying pan and a fourchette will be needed to conduct this technique.&#x20;

## Practice

The technique can be operated as follows:

1. The eggs (2-3) must be broken and "poured" into a salad bowl
2. Grated cheese can be added (unlimited amount)
3. Season and salt are then needed for tasting purposes
4. Mixing the whole content with a spatula will allow to obtain a real omelette
5. The mixed content from the salad bowl onto the frying pan shall then be operated
6. Once cooked, closing the omelette will improve presentation but is a risky process and might require experimented attackers to take the lead on this step
7. Adding parsley is optionnal but can greatly improve taste
8. Savoring the **Omelette du fromage** is then possible.

This technique can be combined with the [banana & chocolate cake](banana-and-chocolate-cake.md) one for a whole meal.
